# ESP-IDF component for MPU6050 6-axis gyroscope and accelerometer based on I2C communication

This is a fork of ESP-IDF MPU6050 driver (https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/mpu6050), which was modified to work with the latest I2C ESP-IDF API (https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/i2c.html).
